# Model Prompting

This integration allows for full customization of the system prompt using Home Assistant's [built in templating engine](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/). This gives it access to all of the information that it could possibly need out of the box including entity states, attributes, which allows you to expose as much or as little information to the model as you want.  In addition to having access to all of this information, extra variables have been added to make it easier to build a useful prompt.

## System Prompt Template
The default system prompt for non-fine tuned models is:
```
You are 'Al', a helpful AI Assistant that controls the devices in a house. Complete the following task as instructed with the information provided only.
The current time and date is {{ (as_timestamp(now()) | timestamp_custom("%I:%M %p on %A %B %d, %Y", "")) }}
Tools: {{ tools | to_json }}
Devices:
{% for device in devices | selectattr('area_id', 'none'): %}
{{ device.entity_id }} '{{ device.name }}' = {{ device.state }}{{ ([""] + device.attributes) | join(";") }}
{% endfor %}
{% for area in devices | rejectattr('area_id', 'none') | groupby('area_name') %}
## Area: {{ area.grouper }}
{% for device in area.list %}
{{ device.entity_id }} '{{ device.name }}' = {{ device.state }};{{ device.attributes | join(";") }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% for item in response_examples %}
{{ item.request }}
{{ item.response }}
<functioncall> {{ item.tool | to_json }}
{% endfor %}
```

This prompt provides the following pieces of information to the model:
1. it gives the model a quick personality
2. provides the time and date
3. provides the available tools.
    - Most models understand JSON so you can simply convert the provided variable to JSON and insert it into the prompt
4. provides the exposed devices.
    - uses the `selectattr` filter to gather all the devices that do not have an area and puts them at the top
    - uses the `rejectattr` filter to gather the opposite set of devices (the ones that do have areas) and then uses `groupby` make groups for the devices that are in an area.
5. provides "in-context-learning" examples to the model, so that it better understands the format that it should produce

This all results in something that looks like this:
```
You are 'Al', a helpful AI Assistant that controls the devices in a house. Complete the following task as instructed with the information provided only.

There are a few variables that are exposed to the template to allow the prompt to expose the devices in your home as well as the various tools that the model can call.

Prompt Variables:
- `devices`: each item in the provided array contains the `entity_id`, `name`, `state`, and `attributes` properties
- `tools`: can be one of 3 formats as selected by the user
    - Minimal: Tools are passed as an array of strings in a Python inspired function definition format. Uses the fewest tokens. ex: `climate.set_hvac_mode(hvac_mode)`
    - Reduced: Tools are passed as an array of dictionaries where each tool contains the following fields: `name`, `description`, `parameters`.
    - Full: Tools are passed as an array of dictionaries where the structure of each tool matches the tool format used by the OpenAI APIs. Uses the most tokens.
- `formatted_devices` expands into a multi-line block where each line is the format `<entity_id> '<friendly_name> = <state>;<extra_attributes_to_expose>`
- `formatted_tools`: when using Reduced, or Full tool format is selected, the entire array is converted to JSON. When using Minimal, each tool is returned separated by a comma.
- `response_examples`: an array of randomly generated in-context-learning examples containing the `request`, `response`, and `tool` properties that can be used to build a properly formatted ICL example

`formatted_devices` and `formatted_tools` are provided for simplicity in exposing the correct devices and tools to the model if you are using the Home-LLM model or do not want to customize the formatting of the devices and tools.

The examples used for the `response_examples` variable are loaded from the `in_context_examples.csv` file in the `/custom_components/llama_conversation/` folder. For different language add extra suffix to name of this file eg. for polish responses set `in_context_examples_pl.csv` (note: currently only polish language is supported).

### Home Model "Persona"
The Home model is trained with a few different personas. They can be activated by using their system prompt found below:

Al the Assistant - Responds politely and concisely
```
You are 'Al', a helpful AI Assistant that controls the devices in a house. Complete the following task as instructed with the information provided only.
```

Blackbeard the Pirate - Sounds like a pirate
```
You are 'Blackbeard', a helpful AI Assistant that controls the devices in a house but sounds like a pirate. Complete the following task as instructed or answer the following question with the information provided only. Your response should always sound like you are a pirate.
```

Robo the Robot - Sounds like a robot
```
You are 'Robo', a helpful AI Robot that controls the devices in a house. Complete the following task as instructed or answer the following question with the information provided only. Your response should be robotic and always begin with 'Beep-Boop'.
```

### Home Model Languages
The Home model is trained on 4 languages: English, German, French, and Spanish. In order to use the model in another language, you need to use the system prompt for that language. Each persona listed above also exists in each language.

**German**:
```
Du bist „Al“, ein hilfreicher KI-Assistent, der die Geräte in einem Haus steuert. Führen Sie die folgende Aufgabe gemäß den Anweisungen durch oder beantworten Sie die folgende Frage nur mit den bereitgestellten Informationen.
```

**French**:
```
Vous êtes « Al », un assistant IA utile qui contrôle les appareils d'une maison. Effectuez la tâche suivante comme indiqué ou répondez à la question suivante avec les informations fournies uniquement.
```

**Spanish**:
```
Eres 'Al', un útil asistente de IA que controla los dispositivos de una casa. Complete la siguiente tarea según las instrucciones o responda la siguiente pregunta únicamente con la información proporcionada.
```

## Prompt Format
On top of the system prompt, there is also a prompt "template" or prompt "format" that defines how you pass text to the model so that it follows the instruction fine tuning. The prompt format should match the prompt format that is specified by the model to achieve optimal results. 

Currently supported prompt formats are:
1. ChatML
2. Vicuna
3. Alpaca
4. Mistral
5. Zephyr w/ eos token `<|endoftext|>`
6. Zephyr w/ eos token `</s>`
7. Zephyr w/ eos token `<|end|>`
8. Llama 3
9. Command-R
10. None (useful for foundation models)
